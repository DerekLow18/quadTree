# Platformer in Pygame!

As a fun project, I figured I would make a game using pygame. The focus of this project is to explore the basis of making games through pygame, and outside of a game engine, since I already have some experience in coding games in Unity. Making games are a fun way to learn, and explore a fairly recent and dynamic platform for media and art!

# Goals
- Implement quadTree
- Implement SideScrolling
- Explore fun data structure manipulation with game mechanics
- Lean basic image editing and illustration
